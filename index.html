            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>
                I am from Bedford, Iowa about 30 minutes north of Maryville. In high school I was able to take online
                college courses through Southwestern Iowa Community College, Graceland, and Iowa Western Community
                College. This last summer I was able to intern at American Century Investments on the Integration
                Services team.

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                I have a job offer that I have accepted and will be starting after I graduate in December. I will be
                back on the Integration Services team where we work a lot with ServiceNow, javascript, and powershell.
