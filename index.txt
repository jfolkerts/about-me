I am a senior Computer Science major here at Northwest and I plan to graduate in December of this year.

I am from Bedford, Iowa about 30 minutes north of Maryville.  In high school I was able to take online college courses through Southwestern Iowa Community College, Graceland, and Iowa Western Community College.  This last summer I was able to intern at American Century Investments on the Integration Services team.

I have a job offer that I have accepted and will be starting after I graduate in December.  I will be back on the Integration Services team where we work a lot with ServiceNow, javascript, and powershell.
